# War Wound
When you can't save everyone, who do you choose to let die? 
In War Wound you play a medic on the front lines of war. Casulaties are high, supplies are low, and it's up to you to save as many people as you can. Treat the wounded, manage your supplies, and pray the resupply truck actually makes it to you this week.
